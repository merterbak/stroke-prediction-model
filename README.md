# Stroke Prediction Model
This repository contains code for a stroke prediction model based on the "Stroke Prediction" Dataset, it includes various features related to individuals health and lifestyle factors and whether they have experienced a stroke. our aim is to develop a model that can predict the likelihood of a stroke based on these features. It contains a number of features pertaining to people's health, lifestyle choices, and stroke history. The objective is to create a model that uses these characteristics to forecast the chance of a stroke.
